Step 1:start
Step 2:create a structure node with element vertex and *next
Step 3:read number of vertices and assign to v
Step 4:initialize adj[] with a null
Step 5:read edges and insert them in adj[]
Step 6:represent the edges into adjacency list
Step 7:acquire only for the new node
Step 8:insert the node in the new node
Step 9:go to end of the linked list
Step 10:keep an array visited[] to keep track of the visited vertices
Step 11:if visited[i]=1 represent that vertex is has been visited before and the DFS function
 for some already visited node need not be called
Step 12:repeat the step until all the vertex are visited
Step 13:print the vertex
Step 14:stop
